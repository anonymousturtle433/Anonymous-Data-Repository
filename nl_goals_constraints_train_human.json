Additionally, since there were no enemy troops in any Red country I could easily seize Red during the troop deployment phase. The Red continent also possesses one of two paths into the Purple continent. By placing my remaining troops into Purple_A, I was able to posses the only other country in Purple with incoming paths. Although the black player does have 5 troops in Purple, I am confident that the numerical advantage I will gain by holding all of the Red continent will allow me to eliminate the black forces in the Purple continent early in the game. This will allow me to control two entire continents by only defending two territories, and over time controlling these two continents will give me a huge advantage in troop numbers compared to the two other players. Since Red also has an outgoing path to every other continent, I will be able to easily use my troop advantage to prevent the other players from controlling other continents. ",

I take risk for having some of my troops on red just to gain access purple, because Green also has a good amount of troops and they have access to Red as well. I again like that Red has access to all 4 of the continents. Even if they don't have the biggest territory, I believe with the right amount of troops and tactics it would be very possible to beat other continents. Blue also has access to Purple and that way they can work together to take a big competitor out of the way. Blue isn't very strong, but I believe it could gain with the turns in the game. I feel like it is important to also put some of your troops in the places most people don't think about putting them cause that way they can have the surprise of the underdog. Having access is very important, just as having a good amount of troops in each territory to begin the game. Attacking the biggest continent with the most troops should be a priority and expanding your troops to surrounding them is a good way of doing so.",

Additionally, having six troops at Red_A would allow me to have access to the green continent early on in the game while protecting Red from attacks. Further, having troops at Red_B would allow me to have access to purple continent early on. Additionally, troops in Red_C would give me direct access to both the yellow and blue continents throughout the game. I could accomplish all of these things in one move because of my positioning. Furthermore, because I owned one continent early on, I would have access to more troops per turn then my opponents, giving me the ability to conquer blue continent and yellow continent quicker than my enemies could.

In addition, Red can only be taken by green, which gives that land a defensive advantage. The goal in the beginning of the game is to take over Red A from the Grey player, granting us an immediate continent bonus other people won't have in the early game. At this point, we should concentrate our defense on Red A, the only area we can be attacked from. Red B and Red C should have 2 armies each to maximize their defensive bonuses if attacked, however, if we lose the Red Continent to Green we probably won't have much of a chance left for winning. The rest of my 5 armies should be concentrated on Blue B, which will be used to take over the blue continent. We should generally avoid taking over Blue D first on that continent, as it is an enemy position that can also be fortified from yellow. However, if we move a large force to Blue A, it may prevent the black player from moving pieces into Blue D from Yellow C. If they move too many pieces into blue, it gives us an easier chance to attack from Blue A into Yellow and significantly weaken their position. When attempting attacks throughout the Blue continent, we should choose the smallest and easiest regions to take over first. Utilizing our early country bonuses and territories occupied, we can continue to add troops into blue with the focus of taking it over. Red will not need additional troops, as it will already be heavily fortified on the one area it can be attacked from. Once we have two continents and move into the midgame, our strongest move would be to take over yellow by attacking it from both our Blue and Red continents, using a pincer movement. Once we possess three continents, our goal is to slowly consolidate and make measured movements to whittle away the remaining troops on the board to win.",

Of course my principle goal is to maximize the number of countries ocupied, and I don't think it is necessary to attack just one country at a time, with a well planned strategy, you can start conquering more than one country at the same time.

Additionally, I needed to defend my borders from green continent's attacks. I did this by placing the rest of my troops in Purple_A, which also gave me direct access to green continent in one move. Furthermore, it prevented the black troops in Blue_C from directly attacking me. Another move I considered was placing troops in Red_C. However, since the black and grey players both have strong forces there, I thought it was safer to avoid Red. I has similar thoughts about Blue. Once I accomplished these goals my next course of action will be to take the rest of the purple continent that is unguarded. Once I have accomplished my goals on Purple, I would use the troops I now had to slowly conquer green continent. Once green continent was conquered I would move troops from it to conquer red continent, while also being sure to fortify green A from attack at Yellow D.

There was not much on green so I knew that was a great opportunity for me to win a battle there and also be able to go against purple or red. I also put troops on purple to be able to win a battle there and then move forward and perhaps get something from red or green.

My stake in the yellow territory is minimal, thus that would be the territory that I am willing to sacrifice, as in the long run, I could potentially gain control of that territory based on my strong stake in the green territory.

The seven troops on red would give me the opportunity to battle the other two countries on that continent. From there I should be able to win both battles and gain full control of the continent. Then I can move into both purple and green and start battling there. I put seven troops on the continent with the color purple in order to battle a few countries on that continent. Winning those battles will go along way in helping me get more troops and launch more attacks on continent green. It would also allow me to defend myself from any attacks from continent blue.

I merely need to hold on to this country for the sake of occupying the entire continent. Yellow_B, Yellow_C, and Yellow_D each have 3 troops because they all need to be defended and/or are points from which I can attack other continents.

With the two largest continents under our control, we should be able to win the long game by gaining more tokens each turn than any other player. The main focus for playing defense in green is just to prevent gray player from taking over green uncontested. We're also strengthening our position in purple by sitting on Green E, which prevents purple from being attacked from three different directions. By placing all our units in areas we can be attacked, it also frees up space when we get more units to move to the bottom of the purple continent. If the early game goes poorly even if we play defensively, we should move troops out of green to strengthen our position in purple. With a potential early bonus in purple, we should strengthen the areas we can be attacked from. From purple we only have one choice to expand, and that's in green, so we can't let any one person get a strong position on the bottom of the green continent and force us into one spot.",

I also put troops of neighboring borders to make sure I'm not caught off guard. I seriously think this might work out the best but we shall see. I am spread little thin on neighboring borders but my placement there is to slow the enemy down so I can get my troops ready for ultimate battle on my home land. If they do get me I guess I could then move into a weaker continent and take over again then proceed slowing to outer lands and take over poor defended borders if I have to.

I placed nine troops at Yellow_C so that I could have access to continent blue and be able to move onto it/conquer it during the game while still having enough troops to properly defend the yellow country from attack. Additionally, having troops in Yellow C will allow me to take Blue D with no resistance and prevent the grey and black players there from being able to fully control it. I placed three troops in Yellow_B to prevent the grey player from directly attacking me and to defend my borders from attack. I placed two troops in Yellow_D because I must be able to access country green later in the game. I must have four troops in continent yellow to defend it from attack, so having three troops at Yellow B and two in Yellow D will allow me to accomplish that goal while still being able to attack from Yellow_C during the game. My goal is to instantly move troops to continent blue so as to defend it with at least two troops until I can fully move troops there and conquer it later in the game. My main goals in the game are to first prevent continent blue and green from being fully conquered by my opponents and then ensuring that I have full control on continent yellow in order to quickly get troops that can then be used to conquer continent blue and green. I will first conquer continent blue and then move on to conquering continent green. After this, I will then slowly move into continent purple, where it is likely that the enemy troops will be spread out and as a result. Note that I don't want to start with troops on purple, as I want the grey and black players to battle there before I attack, since this will give me an easier time conquering them. Finally, I will go for the red continent to finish the game.",

Surrounding enemy territories is irrelevant; the goal is simply to eliminate units from each continent as quickly as possible. Maximizing the number of countries at the beginning of the game is not an important goal; spreading out troops makes them too vulnerable to attack from other players. Keeping all forces grouped together makes both the probabilities of successful attack and defense higher than keeping troops spread across the available countries on the board. Minimizing the number of battles fought is additionally important; any battle should advance the goal of seizing new territories, but defensive battles should be avoided at all costs to minimize troop losses. Fortifying the four countries on the continent I control will increase the chance of receiving additional troops every turn, which will provide a better chance to achieve the victory condition. Battling a single opponent at a time will reduce that opponents forces while limiting my own loss of units. Keeping all troops on the yellow continent affords the opportunity to attack either green or blue territory, while only requiring the defense of two territories with 5 troops in each. Protecting the borders of yellow will afford a better chance to receive more reinforcements for controlling the continent. Having four countries increases the number of reinforcements received.",

The Purple continent has the fewest Grey and Black troops of any continent, and controlling Purple_A and Purple_E is sufficient to defend all access points to the Purple continent.

Maximizing the number of countries at the beginning of the game is not an important goal; spreading out troops makes them too vulnerable to attack from other players. Keeping all forces grouped together makes both the probabilities of successful attack and defense higher than keeping troops spread across the available countries on the board. Minimizing the number of battles fought is additionally important; any battle should advance the goal of seizing new territories, but defensive battles should be avoided at all costs to minimize troop losses. Seizing control of the red continent early provides the best advantage, only Red A can be attacked, and so it is the only point where defense is required, affording offensive opportunities against all other continents while limiting the number of troops required to be left on defense of the country and the continent to 11. Keeping all troops on the red continent affords the opportunity to attack the purple or green territories, while only requiring the defense of one red territory.

I positioned my troops on Green to ally at the access point to Red. And I tried to stack more troops on blue to protect that access point to Yellow where I also stationed myself, knowing I'm highly outnumbered though. My main goal was to maximize the number of countries occupied so i only put a few in each while also fortifying borders at the same time, so I often placed myself on both ends when I could.",

Purple was an easy choice to stay away from, they only have 1 troop in the whole continent and on one territory. So attacking that should be an easy shot. I tried to put my most troops on Green so I can have access to Red that has the most troops compared to any other continent. Being able to access them because they also have access to all of my continents and that way if they make an attack on my territories I can also attack them back and being able to have access to them makes it better. I also out some of my troops on Blue because there is only 2 troops there already which isn't such a huge amount that I would feel I would be attacked and have no fighting chance on them.",

While the Yellow continent had almost no foreign troops, the border countries of Red and Blue had high numbers of armies to defend against which meant that movement in those directions was limited, but also required higher armies in border countries which also limited movement in other directions because of fewer troops available.  The Purple continent is the worst choice because it has to defend against the access of three other countries at all times. My occupation in Red B with 7 armies will give me the best chance to overtake Red C in the first turn. My occupation in Green D is to protect the Red continent.

I love to be near borders and keep them strong so keep out people and make them want to back off and move to attacking the others. They can take out my other opponents and I will slowly grow stronger and stronger until I'm ready for the finally battle where it will be one on one. I hope this work but either way it should be interesting and very fun to try new strategies out. If I start to get hit too hard I can retreat to one of my other occupied lands and try ti get majority control there as well slowing and safely. I will also do my best to keep troops in green close together and expand out wards til I have full control. I hope that my opponents mostly fight each other in beginning though for this to work. ",

The reason why the blue country is important is that it is the most defensible country, with only two attack points. At the moment one of those attack points (yellow C to blue D) is empty, giving us an easier chance to take over without worrying about being attacked. In addition, because the blue country has multiple players on it, there may be additional in-fighting that will support our position. Having such a commanding amount of armies on blue may also act as a deterrent for other players to place additional troops on the blue country. Once the blue continent has been taken over, the goal is to consolidate forces on blue and protect Blue B and Blue D from attack. Defending areas should never have less than 3 or 4 armies, and these positions should never attack other regions unless we've lost a blue region. Defensive positions have the advantage in this game, and as such they should always maintain an amount that gives full rolls in combat (2). Once blue is taken over, the goal is to explore other regions for takeover. Considering yellow is completely empty at the moment, there may be an opportunity to attack from Blue A to Yellow C and take more territories pretty quickly. Last, we should be protected from immediate attack from red considering the contested nature of that zone. When a player fully controls a continent, such as yellow or purple, we should harass those positions regularly to remove their full continent bonus. However, we should never overextend our armies and lose large amounts for one attack, as that will make it easy for someone else to clean out our positions. The main goal of this strategy is to simplify the amount of strategy we need to think about in the early game and intimidate other players by going all in on one location. Our first turn should immediately net us two regions, if not the entire country depending on the rest of the placement. If players place large numbers on blue in order to remove us, we should play more defensively and attack the least occupied region in blue. We want the other players to attack us, as we defensively have a better chance of whittling down their army sizes. However, if players do not place many other armies in blue, we're guaranteed a strong foothold in which to expand across the board.",

I place 12 out of the 14 troops on Red A for both defensive and offensive reasons. Defensively wise, this makes sense because I am defending the only access point to the Red continent. This also makes sense in an offensive manner as this allows me to start expanding my empire into the Green Continent which will allow me to increase my troop production.

Furthermore, having troops at Red_A allowed me to quickly access green continent in one move by going to Greed_D from Red_A. I planned on having my troops at Red_A conquer both Red_C and Red_B early on, giving me control of all of red continent at the beginning. This would give me access to move countries without much resistance and because there are no close enemies early on, it isn't likely that I will be attacked quickly as the enemies at purple continent can't attack me directly. Having troops at Purple_A will prevent my black opponent, who already has three countries in purple continent, from conquering the whole area without resistance. Furthermore, having troops there allows me to also get Green_E in one move without resistance, giving me more troops per turn and allowing me to expand and attack more often in the later rounds.

Green has a good amount of troops in the only territory that is taken, which can also make it tricky. I just felt that If I stayed away from most of the continents that were mostly taken up or had a good amount of troops already there it would be a different way to see the strategies of playing the game. Blue is a continent that also has a fair chance because it is all taken up and all amount of troops are good at the continent.",

Red also gives the advantage of being able to threaten all of the other continents. I put 4 troops each on Red_B and Red_C to do just that. This puts me in a position of strength as invaders will have to go through my strongest point to break my hold on Red, which is a deterrent since they will probably expend some troops to do this and leave themselves weaker elsewhere and vulnerable to the other players.

I don't want to put troops directly on Red, as both the Grey player and the Black player have a strong presence there. I like keeping my troops together on purple but purple does not have an easy path out of it, as it only connects to Green. I will be massing armies in Purple A to move through the green continent to take the red continent. However, I will need to leave 7 troops in purple E to protect Purple from Red and 4 troops in Purple A to protect against the Blue continent. With the other purple countries, this means that I will have to leave at least 14 troops in Purple to maintain control of the continent while I try to take over the Red continent.",

While I can battle for some small stake at this point, I could potentially lose stake in the much larger territories, thus causing myself to potentially lose control of all of my territories. While this is a major risk, this could be a major reward for me if I can ultimately gain control of all the territories.

This would also limit the number of places that the enemy can move freely and it will allow me to benefit from the additional troop bonus for having a presence in other countries.  By limiting the movement of the enemy I can also prevent them from acquiring additional troops and heavily restrict their ability to defend and attack.

Each army has at least 2 troops in it, which should give them all a fighting chance at surviving.  I also felt like the Purple continent presented the best opportunity to control a whole continent, so I did focus 6 of my troops there.  I think the only way to eventually get the armies out of the Red continent is to defeat the other players on the other continents, since Black currently controls the only access point to Red.

I placed a troop at blue to attack purple, I placed a troop at purple to watch what is going on in green if to attack or not. The strategy I made use of is one such that would protect my troops from getting trampled by the other continents. I've made my continent as safe as possible for my troops while also attacking the other continents. Each of the continents will definitely attack back when I strike but my strategy is one that would lure them into striking so I can find their weak point and attack with a smaller troop than what I've got protecting my continent. One would wonder why I'm making use of small troops to attack the other continents, learning from the great Napoleon different war strategies and implementing them has been a dream come true in this study.",

I needed to have all my troops on Blue, because the strategy of occupying at least one continent for its troop bonus is very appealing to me. I placed 3 troops on Blue C with the intention to make one attack to see whether invading Continent Purple would be viable. It is less of an appealing plan to me than taking control of Continent Yellow because it would be more prone to attacks from whoever eventually takes control of Continent Green.

With the players having a lot of troops already on the board, the easiest continent for me to take was Green. This is a good thing because it is also a fairly large continent, and once I have complete control of it I will be gaining a lot of additional troops from it. To ensure i am able to take control and hold control of the Green continent I must first get rid of the 2 troops currently occupying Green E. I also need to make sure that my borders are secure. The player in Continent yellow looks like they have their hands full trying to defend their boarder from Red and from Blue. That means I can dedicate less troops to defend my border from Yellow and worry more about the troops inside Green E as well as the massive amount of troops being built up in Purple A. Also, I assume more troops will be placed in the Red continent, so I made sure that any entrances into The Green continent would be covered. After successfully taking the Green continent, I can use those excess troops in Green D to take over Red A and eventually take another continent. While it is a smaller continent, it seems like one that can be easily taken and then used as a way to attack some of the larger continents while they are occupied with each other. ",

While the Purple continent had almost no foreign troops, it has to defend against the access of three other countries at all times which requires higher numbers of armies to defend limiting movement in those directions as well as movement in other directions because of fewer troops available.  My occupation in Blue D with 4 armies will give me the best chance to overtake Blue D in the first turn. My occupation in Yellow C and Blue B is to protect the Blue continent.

If unopposed, they could have a very strong position with both purple and red continents. Our goal is to reduce their strength by maintaining a numbers advantage on red while we strengthen our position in Green. If grey does not contest purple, it will be our job to attack into purple and prevent the country bonus. We don't have to take over purple early game, but we want to stop black from getting any continent bonuses. While that happens, our goal is to control parts of the green continent and avoid directly attacking unless there are positions of weakness (2 or less armies in a tile). We want other players to attack us in green, as defense tends to have the advantage and this will allow us to thin out player numbers without risking as many units. Our secondary goal is to slowly push black out of the red territory. We'll need to judge the black player to see if they'll play aggressively from their position of Red C or not. If they're aggressive, we should avoid attacking them back until they lose a significant amount of armies, allowing us to take over the country using our strength from the other two red tiles. If we do this, we should have the first continent bonus in the game, as all other continents are hotly contested between black and gray. If this all goes well, we should consider completely taking over the green continent. Defensive armies should sit with at least 4 troops. Our main concern is being attacked from purple, so as long as purple is not completely owned by black we should defend green and not proactively attack into purple. Our next goal if we own green and red is to attack into either blue or yellow, depending on which continent's position is the weaker. So as a summary, this game style should be more conservative, protecting the spaces we have, reducing black's ability to get continent bonuses, and slowly strengthening our position on the northern part of the board.",

All other forces should be dedicated to expanding into blue, compounding our early advantage of troops. We should let gray and black fight it out over purple, as this will probably be the last country we take over. If we own red and blue mid-game, we should have a strong position to win the game. I would move into yellow and slowly expand our power in green, basically encircling the rest of the player tokens. The main focus is to prevent continent bonuses for other players in regions near ours and expand control with our early red continent bonuses, making us stronger and stronger.

Additionally, there is only one opponent on Red with one army which makes it very easy to overtake on the first turn. So, it doesn't matter how small the continent bonus is, it will be an easy early advantage to claim. The first attack would be Red A to Red B to overtake the Red continent, moving remaining armies to occupy Red B. This will serve to build up armies over time to eventually attack Purple if his attacks dwindle down the armies on Purple E. The placement on Green D protects any attacks on the Red continent. The placement on Red B is to attack Yellow B which only has one army, also in the first turn. This serves to expand occupation. Overall, the bordering territories will have a high degree of defense expecting low to no losses at the end of the first round and great position for further expansion.",

I also felt like red had the most access to any other country. They have access to all 4 countries, yellow, blue, green, and also purple. I chose to put some troops in yellow as well  because the country of green has very little troops on it so it could be an easy target to hit. I try to scatter them the most even if it means I put only 1 troop in one country. One is better than none, so to have a fair and even chance I think putting at least one troop in the country would allow me to put a fair fight in the game and have a possibility to win at the game. Purple is a strong country to go against, it has a lot of troops but I think being able to access it through red  and green it makes it a good chance as well.",

I could try to challenge the purple continent by putting troops into it, however, it would be safer to take control of the red continent and then push out from there. I want to make sure that I have a strong control of Red continents borders and then try and push out into the weakest continent. Red continent has a great advantage because the Red C territory can attack Yellow B or Blue B. This is a great advantage. I put a lot of troops on Red C to be able to attack The Blue Continent or the Yellow Continent quickly. I assume I will gain control and be able to protect the Red continent fairly quickly, So I would like to push out into Blue or Yellow soon. Luckily for me, the troops in the Purple Continent do not seem like a threat. This makes things easy for me as I do not need to commit as many troops into Red B for defensive purposes. Therefore, as the Troops in continent Blue and Yellow begin to fight, I will be able to take the continent which has less troops in it. I will quickly have the advantage because I will have a complete continent while the other players will not be receiving that troop bonus. So as they fight for position, my troop size will only grow stronger. The hope would be to take control of Continent Red and then Continent Blue and Yellow. From there I should have enough territory and troop reinforcements to be able to take the rest of the map. With a starting position on Continent Red, I do not have to worry about attacks from anywhere but Green. This is a very strong position to have as it will allow me to focus my troops elsewhere. ",

By putting a lot of my troops on yellow where it was mostly all empty it gives me a chance to have access and a good amount of troops on blue and green which both have a good amount of troops already. I also wanted to have access to all continents that's why I also chose to put my troops on Red, and protecting the borders by putting them on Red_A and also Red_B. I also chose to put at least 2 troops on Green because they seem to have a good amount of troops already stationed there. But it also works to stay close to your competitors and enemies. So in case you need to defend yourself, you are already there close by also. Having my troops on Red also serves as an advantage because you again have access to all on the game. So I would try to put a lot of my troops on there and make the border strong and make it nearly impossible for the other continents be able to attacks and of course have access to Red.",

As there are already two from another team I will need to attack them first and plan for extra troops just in case that does not work.  From there I deduced that I would need to attack Purple second, as their troop number was high.  Anticipating that battle, I sat a high number of troops bordering in the Green section, so I would be prepared.  Assuming that went well, I would be safe to defend from Yellow.  I place a few troops on Blue thinking that a circle would be made where my troops would meet in the middle at blue.",
