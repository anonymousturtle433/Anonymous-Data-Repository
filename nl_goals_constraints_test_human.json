Green will be the biggest challenge as they have the most number of troops with 20 that they can move around, so the strategy would be to gain control of red as quickly as possible before moving in on yellow while leaving the borders of red as strong as possible. Gaining control of yellow and red would allow me to keep green on the defense from opposite sides, but give me access to work control of blue as green will most likely make moves to gain purple as a stronghold. The trick will be playing a long game to maintain control of the split continents while green will ultimately control the center of the board until I can attempt to force them down into the purple region and attack from several sides.",
