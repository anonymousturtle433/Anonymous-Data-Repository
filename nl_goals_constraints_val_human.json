In order to do that, I needed to have troops at Red_B and Red_C, allowing me to attack Red_A directly and control the red continent. Placing troops on Red_B and Red_C as well as Blue_B allowed me to have troops on three countries at the start, which was important. I needed to also be able to attack the purple continent in one move, which was achieved by placing troops in Red_B. I also needed to be able to attack yellow continent early on in the game, which was accomplished by placing five troops in Red_C. Additionally, placing troops at Blue_B allowed me to have troops in two continents while also allowing me to reinforce and access the blue continent in one move. In having troops in Red_C I could quickly control all of red continent. From there, I could move troops from Red_B into purple continent in one move by going into Purple_E that had be left unguarded. I could then continue to expand and place troops their quickly without much threat of attack from others. This would allow me to conquer purple fairly quickly in the game, giving me access to more troops which I could then use to move into green continent later in the game. Having troops in Blue B would not only allow for quick reinforcement early on, but it would also allow me to add troops there and then conquer blue continent early on in the game. I would move from Blue_B into Blue_A and from their move into yellow continent. This would prevent my opponents from getting a full continent as most of them are spread out and the majority of their troops are concentrated in green continent. This means they are likely to fight each other during my moves and also makes it less likely that they will be able to stop my expansion directly as I will have conquered countries that could attack my red continent directly fairly early on in the game.",

For example, Yellow C would have more than the 3 troops from Blue A, more than 2 troops on Yellow B since Red C has two, more than 3 troops on Yellow D, and at least one troop on Yellow A. I also wanted to ensure that I was considering the direction in which attacks were being conducted. In this instance, I could attack two continents, Blue and Green, while also being attacked by two other continents - this maximizes my battles partially. I also did not surround enemies, I just wanted to consolidate my troops in one area to make sure I had a stronghold on my territory. I chose to only occupy 4 countries rather than 7 because I figured I would be able to keep those 4 countries into future turns. Finally, I didn't think about battling one opponent at a time, I was focused more on other goals and by doing so, this goal fell by the wayside.",

Because Red can only be attack by one Country, Red really only needs to be defended on one front which allows me to concentrate my power there. In addition, I decided to maximize my territory control this game due to the fact that there are many uncontested pieces that can be held with minimum effort. For instance, the pieces that I choose on the Blue and Purple continent are all pieces are at least 2 turns away from attack allowing me to collect extra pieces for those turns. In addition, by adding most of my forces to the Red continent, I am able to concentrate my forces on attacking the rest of the Red continent as well as defending it from the Green continent.",

The goal is to maintain a strong defense to discourage attack by other players, and to wait for troop reinforcements to give enough of a numerical advantage to permit attack against either the green or blue continent, depending on game condition. Surrounding enemy territories is irrelevant; the goal is simply to eliminate units from each continent as quickly as possible. Maximizing the number of countries at the beginning of the game is somewhat important with this board; three purple territories can safely be occupied with only one troop each. Keeping all forces grouped together makes both the probabilities of successful attack and defense higher than keeping troops spread across the available countries on the board. Minimizing the number of battles fought is additionally important; any battle should advance the goal of seizing new territories, but defensive battles should be avoided at all costs to minimize troop losses. Keeping 5 troops on the two purple territories that can be attacked should reduce the likelihood of other players successfully attacking. Placing units on any other continent is poor strategy; maintaining as many units as possible on the two vulnerable purple territories is a better use of troops, both to reduce the chance of receiving attacks and to permit an attack to be made against the green continent.",

Once yellow was fortified from attacks, I looked for the nearest continent I'd like to occupy, which was green; I decided this somewhat arbitrarily, mainly because green was nearby and the pathway to green from yellow didn't need defending since the arrow only went one way. I positioned the of my troops on green rather than on the borders of yellow so I didn't have to waste a move before attacking green. The amount allocated to green was the amount of pieces I had remaining, five, which should be enough to take out one side of green and potentially another as well if I move additional pieces from yellow over.

Red A is the only red territory requiring defense, allowing all additional troops to be used to attack Blue. Once blue is defeated, only two territories, Red A and Blue D require defense, allowing an attack against Yellow or Purple on later turns. Surrounding enemy territories is irrelevant; the goal is simply to eliminate units from each continent as quickly as possible. Maximizing the number of countries at the beginning of the game is not an important goal; spreading out troops makes them too vulnerable to attack from other players. Keeping all forces grouped together makes both the probabilities of successful attack and defense higher than keeping troops spread across the available countries on the board. Minimizing the number of battles fought is additionally important; any battle should advance the goal of seizing new territories, but defensive battles should be avoided at all costs to minimize troop losses. Controlling all of the red continent early provides the best advantage, only Red A can be attacked, and so it is the only point where defense is required, affording offensive opportunities against all other continents while minimizing the number of troops required to be left on defense. Keeping all troops on the red continent affords the opportunity to attack the purple, green, blue, or yellow territories, while only requiring the defense of one red territory. By protecting Red A with 10 troops I will also be protecting the borders of red which will afford a better chance to receive more reinforcements for controlling the continent.",

Maximizing the number of countries at the beginning of the game is not an important goal; spreading out troops makes them too vulnerable to attack from other players. Keeping all forces grouped together makes both the probabilities of successful attack and defense higher than keeping troops spread across the available countries on the board. Minimizing the number of battles fought is additionally important; any battle should advance the goal of seizing new territories, but defensive battles should be avoided at all costs to minimize troop losses. Seizing control of the red continent early provides the best advantage, only Red A can be attacked, and so it is the only point where defense is required, affording offensive opportunities against all other continents while limiting the number of troops required to be left on defense to 7. Keeping all troops on the red continent affords the opportunity to attack the purple, yellow, or blue territories, while only requiring the defense of one red territory. Protecting the borders of red will afford a better chance to receive more reinforcements for controlling the continent.",

Yellow C also has the added bonus of having access to Blue D, which would likely be my next target in terms of conquering continents. I placed 3 troops on Yellow D with the intention to attack Green A. My future actions are determined by the outcome of the first battle between Yellow D and Green A. If the attack is to great success, I would heavily consider invading Continent Green as Player Black's numbers would be low. If the attack is unsuccessful, I would focus more on spreading out to Continent Blue as it poses more of an addressable threat than Continent Green does. I imposed the rule \"I must have troops on Yellow\" because I noticed that both player White and Black tried focusing on being in 3 different continents, which I feel could be countered by placing strength into one continent with its troop bonus. Speaking of continent control bonuses, I placed only one troop in Yellow A because it is inaccessible without attacking the surrounding countries. I felt secure in only placing one troop there so I can maintain full control of Continent Yellow.",

I would then have access to yellow and green directly with one move. Further, I wanted troops on continent green at the borders of red and purple to defend green and slowly begin to impose on each country within green and get to green A where I would battle for the last country. Putting troops on green E and D ensures that I have quick access to red and purple with one move and I could focus on gaining control of those after I have overtaken green and yellow.",
